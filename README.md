# Automated_attendence

Haar Cascade classifier used for face detection.Haar cascade. Haar Cascade is a machine learning object detection algorithm used to identify objects in an image or video and based on the concept of feature.Haar Cascade classifier is based on the Haar Wavelet technique to analyse pixels in the image into squares by function. ... Haar cascade classifier is based on Viola Jones detection algorithm which is trained in given some input faces and non-faces and training a classifier which identifies a face. Automated Attendance System is the advancement that has taken place in the field of automation replacing traditional attendance marking activity. Since taking attendance requires time and also prone to proxy making it automated with using face recognition system will increase efficiency.

### The main elements of this technology are as follows
* Face detection(using OpenCV 4 module)
* Face recognition(face recognition module)

### Features

* Face recognition can be done passively without any explicit action or participation on the part of the user since faces can be acquired from a distance by the camera.
* Auto-generate various types of reports of class or student attendance
* Real time attendance status tracking.
* Effective recognition of unique faces in a crowd (individual recognition in crowd).
