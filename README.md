# Automated_attendence

In this era of automation many scientific advancements and inventions have taken place to save labor, increase the accuracy and to ameliorate our lives. Automated Attendance System is the advancement that has taken place in the field of automation replacing traditional attendance marking activity. Since taking attendance requires time and also prone to proxy making it automated with using face recognition system will increase efficiency. Even if a new student enters into class, an unsupervised technique can help notifying number of days of his presence in class. As our university is growing, automation will be an enhancement over traditional technologies of student or employee attendance system and also this can be applied on Main Gate to have watch on every incoming-outgoing person.

### The main elements of this technology are as follows
* Face detection(using OpenCV 4 module)
* Face recognition(face recognition module)

### Features

* Face recognition can be done passively without any explicit action or participation on the part of the user since faces can be acquired from a distance by the camera.
* Auto-generate various types of reports of class or student attendance
* Real time attendance status tracking.
* Effective recognition of unique faces in a crowd (individual recognition in crowd).
